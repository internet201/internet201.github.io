	<h2>What is this?</h2>
		<p>This is a harmless site meant to warn any visitors about the dangers of phishing sites.</p>
		<p>A phishing site may try to trick you into giving up your social security number, credit card number, or simply any information that a hacker may find useful. Also, a phishing site may attempt to plant malware on your device.</p>
		
	<h2>How did I get here?</h2>
		<p>There are many ways you could've arrived here:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				maybe you clicked on a link in an email like this<br>
				<img src="images/email-phishing3.PNG" alt="Insert phishing email image here">
			</li>

			<li>
				maybe you clicked on a banner like this<br>
				<img src="images/website-phishing2.PNG" alt="Insert phishing banner here"><br>
			</li>
				
			<li>
				maybe it just popped up like this
				<div class="popup">Click here to launch a pop up link</div><br>
			</li>

			<li>
				or maybe you arrived via other methods I don't know of
			</li>
		</ul>
			
	<h2>This sounds bad. How do I stop it?</h2>
		<p>There are a few ways to protect yourself from phishing attacks:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Companies will never ask you to do anything on your account through email.</b> 
				<div class="example">In the worst case, a company will put out a notice on the main website telling you if it is needed.</div>
				<div class="example"><b>It never hurts to contact the company to check first.</b></div>
			</li><br>

			<li>
				Make sure that if you are giving sensitive information, check that the website is trustworthy and authentic.<br>
				
				<div class="example">
					If the website needs to deal with sensitive information, it should have a padlock on the top right corner, like so: <img src="images/padlock.png" alt="insert green padlock image here">
					<br><b>If a website doesn't have such a padlock, do not give it any sensitive information.</b>
				</div><br>

				<div class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> Just because a website has a green padlock does not mean it's trustworthy. <a href="NULL">Click here to find out what the padlock really means. (under construction)</a></div>
			</li><br>
			
			<li>
				No individuals would ever reach out to you in order to give you a prize without having you give anything in return.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>This may seem obvious, but it's worth saying it again and again: <b>If it's too good to be true, it probably is.</b></p>
